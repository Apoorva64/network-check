**Network Checker App for Kubernetes** 🌐

This repository contains a simple application designed to check network connectivity within a Kubernetes cluster and report the information to Prometheus for monitoring purposes. 🚀

### Overview ℹ️

The network checker application is built to monitor network latency and availability between pods within a Kubernetes cluster. It periodically tests connectivity between pods and reports the results to Prometheus using metrics exposed through a Pushgateway. 📊

### Features 🛠️

- Periodically checks network connectivity between pods in the Kubernetes cluster. 🔄
- Reports network latency and availability metrics to Prometheus for monitoring. 📈
- Supports authentication for pushing metrics to the Prometheus Pushgateway. 🔒
- Can be deployed as a DaemonSet in a Kubernetes cluster for easy scalability and monitoring. 🚢

### Prerequisites 📋

- Kubernetes cluster 📦
- Access to Prometheus Pushgateway 🔑

### Deployment 🚀

The project is deployed using Kustomize. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `/manifest` directory.

2. Customize the deployment configurations in the `kustomization.yaml` file to match your environment, including Prometheus credentials and other configuration options if necessary.

3. Apply the deployment using Kustomize.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k .
   ```

### Configuration ⚙️

- `NAMESPACE`: Namespace in which the network checker application will operate. 📂
- `NETWORK_LATENCY_METRIC`: Name of the Prometheus metric for network latency. 📉
- `NETWORK_AVAILABLE_METRIC`: Name of the Prometheus metric for network availability. 📈
- `PROMETHEUS_PUSHGATEWAY`: URL of the Prometheus Pushgateway. 🚪
- `PROMETHEUS_USERNAME`: Username for authenticating with the Prometheus Pushgateway. 👤
- `PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD`: Password for authenticating with the Prometheus Pushgateway. 🔑

### Usage 🚀

Once deployed, the network checker application will start monitoring network connectivity between pods in the Kubernetes cluster. Metrics will be reported to Prometheus, which can then be visualized and monitored using Prometheus and Grafana. 📊
